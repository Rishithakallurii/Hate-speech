# Hate-speech Detection
# Overview
This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models for detecting hate speech in text. We use three different classifiers: Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression. The goal is to accurately classify text as 'hate speech', 'offensive language', or 'no hate or offensive'.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib, nltk.

# Dataset 
The dataset consists of text samples labeled into three categories:

Hate Speech
Offensive Language
No Hate or Offensive
